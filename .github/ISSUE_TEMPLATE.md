Github is a place only for reporting bugs or feature requests.
If you report a bug please include always the following informations:

* Security plugin and Elasticsearch version
* JVM version and operating system version
* Number of nodes in your cluster
* Description of the bug

These informations are optional but are very valueable and
typically would lead to get bugs fixed faster:

* Steps to reproduce
* Logfiles on DEBUG level
